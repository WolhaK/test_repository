Never knew this thing, never stranger
Never fucked the words like a razor
But I won't give a damn 'bout it later
All the little digs doesn't matter
Writing down a brand new chapter
When there's only love, never anger

So lonely in your bed
Does breaking me make you feel good?
Guess you don't understand
What goes around, comes around
