Never knew this thing, never stranger
Never fucked the words like a razor
But I won't give a damn 'bout it later
All the little digs doesn't matter
Writing down a brand new chapter
When there's only love, never anger

So lonely in your bed
Does breaking me make you feel good?
Guess you don't understand
What goes around, comes around

I’ll put the past behind
But I wouldn’t put it past you
